# PortfolioWebsite
My porfoilio website. 

Created for self-study and practicing the combination of CSS3, HTML5 and JavaScript programming.

Technologies used:

HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript for base.
JQuery is used for AOS and other modules.

Animations - some taken from AOS (scrolling tansitions) and some I made.
Topbar is Bootstrap 4's navbar with little modification.

I'll update the portfolio anytime a new skill has learned.


# Budgety
The Budgety's base app files are taken from "The Complete JavaScript Course: Build a Real-World Project" by 
Jonas Schmedtmann's course on Udemy.
